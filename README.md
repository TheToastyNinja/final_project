# Final Project
#### Info 201 final project
Over the years, the U.S. housing rental market have played an important and influential role in America's economy. As the cities expand and housing prices continue to grow, renting an apartment, instead of buying a home, has become more and more popular, especially among the younger generations and in the metro areas. As people are making one of the largest decisions in anyone's life, which home to buy, it is worth considering that renting can be more beneficial and realistic, due to renting's advantages including lower initial investment, less responsibilities, less tax impact, more rooms for flexible budgeting and so on. Therefore, in this data report, we want to exam how the housing rental market in the U.S. has evolved over time. Using the data provided by Zillow, we examined the  rental markets of one-bedroom apartments, two-bedroom apartments, three-bedroom apartments, four-bedroom apartments, five-bedroom apartments, studios, condo homes, duplex triplex, and single family residences. The analysis is based on how the markets have varied across the nation, differed among various states, and changed over the years. Using our data report, users can utilize the past data to predict the trends of housing rentals in the future.
